``ts_ATMCSSimulator`` is an LSST Telescope and Site package that provides a simulator for the auxiliary telescope motor control system (ATMCS).

The package is compatible with LSST DM's ``scons`` build system and ``eups`` package management system.
Assuming you have the basic LSST DM stack installed you can do the following, from within the package directory:

* ``setup -r .`` to setup the package and dependencies.
* ``scons`` to build the package and run unit tests.
* ``scons install declare`` to install the package and declare it to eups.
* `package-docs build` to build the documentation.
  This requires ``documenteer``; see `building single package docs`_ for installation instructions.
